# Project Plan

## Overview
This project involves addressing bugs, upgrading features, and adding new functionalities for a music app, with multi-platform support (Android, iOS, and Web). The following plan outlines the necessary steps for implementation.

---

## 1. **Fix Bugs and Stabilize Core Functionality**

- **Banner Ad Issue**: Fix the issue where the banner ad goes behind the content. Ensure that ads are properly layered and visible.
- **Music Stopping After Minimizing**: Resolve the issue of music stopping after 15 seconds when the app is minimized. Implement background music playback that works seamlessly even when the app is in the background.

## 2. **Upgrade Features for Monetization and User Experience**

- **Banner Ad Replacement**: Replace the current banner ad with full-page interstitial ads, optimizing for frequency and placement.
- **Payment Integration**: Replace the QR code payment with an integrated payment window, supporting multiple plans (yearly, monthly, weekly, daily).
- **Post-Payment Changes**: Implement functionality that disables ads and enables chat after payment is made (e.g., show a message asking users to restart the app).
- **User Profile Creation**: Implement a proper user profile with options for profile pictures and personal details.
- **Auth0 Integration**: Integrate Auth0 for user login via Google or Facebook.

---
## 3. **Enhance User Interaction and Communication Features**

- **User Interaction**: Upon clicking a username in the liked features list, provide options to add a connection or report the user. 
- **Chat Feature**: Enable the chat feature once the connection request is accepted (premium feature).
- **Music Sharing in Chat**: Allow users to share music in the chat feature.
- **Live Music Feed**: Implement live music feed rooms (similar to Discord) for real-time music discussions.

## 4. **Implement Personalized Music Experience with Machine Learning**

- **Recommendation Engine**: Develop an ML-based recommendation engine that suggests songs based on the user's most played songs.
- **Playlist Creation**: Allow users to create their own playlists, both individually and collaboratively (premium feature).

---
## 5. **Search and Discovery**

- **Search Functionality**: Implement a search feature to allow users to search by song name, artist name, album name, or playlist name.
- **User Interface**: Design and integrate the search UI across all platforms.

## 6. **Add Music Features and Customization Options**

- **Offline Music**: Implement song downloading and offline playback functionality.
- **Song Lyrics**: Include song lyrics for all available tracks.
- **Light and Dark Mode**: Add a toggle to switch between light and dark modes.
