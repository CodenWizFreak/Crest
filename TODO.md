# Project Plan

## Overview
This project involves addressing bugs, upgrading features, and adding new functionalities for a music app, with multi-platform support (Android, iOS, and Web). The following plan outlines the necessary steps for implementation.

---

## 1. **Fix Bugs and Stabilize Core Functionality**

- **Banner Ad Issue**: Fix the issue where the banner ad goes behind the content. Ensure that ads are properly layered and visible.
- **Music Stopping After Minimizing**: Resolve the issue of music stopping after 15 seconds when the app is minimized. Implement background music playback that works seamlessly even when the app is in the background.

## 2. **Upgrade Features for Monetization and User Experience**

- **Banner Ad Replacement**: Replace the current banner ad with full-page interstitial ads, optimizing for frequency and placement.
- **Payment Integration**: Replace the QR code payment with an integrated payment window, supporting multiple plans (yearly, monthly, weekly, daily).
- **Post-Payment Changes**: Implement functionality that disables ads and enables chat after payment is made (e.g., show a message asking users to restart the app).
- **User Profile Creation**: Implement a proper user profile with options for profile pictures and personal details.
- **Auth0 Integration**: Integrate Auth0 for user login via Google or Facebook.
